    # Placeholder: Future implementation will use matplotlib to create a
    # 17-segment AHA bullseye plot.
    # For example, a very simple plot could be:
    # if ecv_map is not None and ecv_map.size > 0:
    #     plt.figure()
    #     plt.imshow(ecv_map, cmap='viridis')
    #     plt.title("ECV Map (Placeholder Bullseye)")
    #     plt.colorbar(label="ECV (%)")
    #     plt.show() # In a script, plt.show() would display. In a library, usually you return the figure.
    # else:
    #     print("ECV map is empty or None, cannot display plot.")

    # For now, we are just printing the message as per requirements.
