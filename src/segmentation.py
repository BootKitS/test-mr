def segment_heart(dicom_data: pydicom.dataset.FileDataset):
    """
    Simulates the segmentation of the heart's endocardium and epicardium contours
    from a DICOM data object.

    This is a placeholder implementation. In a real scenario, this function
    would contain image processing or machine learning logic to extract
    the contours from the pixel data in dicom_data.

    Args:
        dicom_data (pydicom.dataset.FileDataset): The DICOM data object containing
                                                 the image and metadata.

    Returns:
        tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: A tuple containing two NumPy arrays:
                                       - endocardium_contour: Placeholder for endocardium points.
                                       - epicardium_contour: Placeholder for epicardium points.
                                       Both are currently empty NumPy arrays.
